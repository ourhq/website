# OurHQ: A inclusive online community for youth

**OurHQ** is a youth-focused online community based in Palo Alto started by youth from [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints][lds] in this area.
We connect youth and mentors together so we can:

- Explore and learn about a variety of interests and skills
- Socialize and meet new people with diverse backgrounds
- Provide grassroots leadership and service opportunities
- Have a good time!

Being an online community, we're not restricted to discrete blocks of time to meet together.
Most of our activities and members organically come and go throughout the week.

We’d love to share what we know and have you contribute.
If you want to just come for the company, even if you’re working on your own stuff, please join!
Want to create an Among Us lobby with voice comms? We can do that, too.
Want to come and just shoot the breeze? Great!
Want some feedback on something you’re working on (e.g., a talk, an idea, a recipe, a game you made, etc.)? You’ll have an audience here.
No matter what's happening out in the world, if you're working on something and want some company, or are just bored and want to see what's happening in our community, feel free to pop in!

# Special Events

We also have regularly scheduled events where we can gather together as a community to enjoy things like starting a new project, listening to a talk, playing some games, and/or discussing new ideas.
You can find when these events will be happening on the calendar below.
If you're interested in getting involved in one of these events, [let us know][email]!
