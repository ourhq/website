# Why use Discord?
We wanted a user-friendly community space to hang out in during this pandemic.
We like the flexibility it gives us to hop around different channels, voice chat, screen share, listen to music together, share files, etc.
It mimics the serendipity of a physical community space, while still conforming to safety guidelines.
